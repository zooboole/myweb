 <p> Welcome to the home page which is file &#34;home.htm&#34; in folder ui </p>
                <p>If you click on  blog link on menu ,you will not see anything because 
                there are no blog Entries.
                To submit a new blog log in as admin & follow the links.
                 Them maybe try a test blog comment, then remove comment from showing 
                 using moderate comment link</p> 
 
				<p>Apart from the home page every other page which does not have 
				allocated to it a specific route will be loaded by PHP Class Page.php .
				Basically to create a new static page all you have to do is open 
				template.htm & save it as something else in the UI folder where template.htm is
				 say &#34;about_us.htm&#34; </p><p>template.htm just consists of a couple of
				  divs with class 	col-sm-12 text-left , that's because i&#39;m using 
				  Twitter Bootstrap for the front end, which  makes the pages respond 
				  & re-size when they are viewed on a smart phone. Template.htm also does not have
				  a page header or footer; that's because when there is  GET request for a page
				  with for instance url /template class page basically injects 
				  the content of the page 	from the requested URL & injects it into page.htm		
				</p>
				<p> Its a concept along the lines as that of some other frameworks, which use for instance
				&#34; Blade&#34;It saves a lot of duplication putting the same links & 
				images into each page.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>A link to say to a static page in the top menu bar or a link anywhere on another
				will be in the form :<br>
				<?php echo $randy;?><br></p>
				
				<p>Class Page.php will load the page using the url /about_us ,
				 thats it! theres no need to include the suffix .htm at the end i.e don't use 
				 /about_us.htm</p>
				
				
				<p>Docs for my construction  using fat free is on menu above as are fatfree docs themselves.</p>
				The main fatfree web-site can be accessed using the icon in the page footer below.
